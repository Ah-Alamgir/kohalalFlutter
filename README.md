## About <a name = "about"></a>

Text Scanner is an Android application built with Flutter that leverages the power of Google's ML Kit for text recognition in images. The app provides users with an easy-to-use interface for selecting, capturing, and scanning text from images. Users can also crop and rotate images before scanning. The scanned text can be shared with others using the share functionality.
